"""simplicio-loop — pre-commit hook: auto-sync plugin/ and _bundle/ from source (#98).

Triggered by git pre-commit. Detects staged changes in the monitored source paths
(defined in mirror_manifest.py as the single source of truth) and runs BOTH
`sync_plugin.py` (writes plugin/) and `sync_bundle.py` (writes simplicio_loop/_bundle/)
automatically, adding the regenerated files to the same commit.

Fail-open, per syncer: if either sync fails (e.g. python3 unavailable in the hook, a bug in one
of the two scripts), the commit proceeds silently regardless — a failure in one syncer does not
skip the other — and `python3 scripts/check.py` (via `scripts/claims_audit.py`) catches the
resulting drift as a backstop.

Install (project-local; git hooks are per-repo, so this is a no-op for a --global install):
    # Via installer:
    bash scripts/install.sh <runtime>            # wires this hook into .git/hooks/pre-commit

    # Manual:
    cp hooks/pre-commit.py .git/hooks/pre-commit
    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

Verify: `python3 scripts/doctor.py` reports it under the RECOMMENDED tier (a missing hook never
fails the gate — claims_audit.py still catches drift on the next check/CI run).

Refs: #98 (auto-sync), #74 (mirror_manifest.py single source of truth).
