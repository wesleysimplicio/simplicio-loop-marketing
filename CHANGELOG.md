## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Issue #93 Loop core extension binding:** publishes the pinned `simplicio.loop-extension/v1` marketing manifest, hashed context schemas, declarative stage/role/gate/resource bindings, core-owned budgets, receipt-derived views, and a fenced exactly-once effect adapter. Campaign startup rejects incompatible cores before creating work; doctor reports conformance.

- **Issue #92 conformance certification:** canonical manifest/schema compatibility gate, deterministic manifest and graph hashes, fail-closed incompatible-core handling, exactly-once fenced fake-effect recovery/security coverage, clean-package E2E parity, and documented upgrade/canary/rollback evidence.

- **Loop core release train** (issue #95): official `loop.marketing` extension manifest and immutable core lock; fail-closed component-release compatibility/diff evaluator; 15-minute event/poll reconciliation workflow with deduplicated bump PRs; canary/rollback pins; release identity in campaign manifests and doctor output; unit, integration, E2E, regression coverage and a numeric p95 budget.
- **Issue meta-audit** (#106): fail-closed, reproducible inventory with machine/human receipts and unit, integration, regression, E2E, security, and measured performance coverage.

- **4-layer DoD gate** (issues #99, hub simplicio-loop#579): [`DOD.md`](./DOD.md) documents a correctness-beyond-coverage layer on top of the existing 7 pillars — property-based testing (`fast-check`) for resolution/fan-out logic, real-content fixtures, a PR invariant-review question, and asserting on observable results instead of a reported status. `tests/unit/router-properties.test.ts` is the reference implementation, generating provider/override/env combinations against `lib/router.ts` and asserting determinism, override precedence, and no env-noise leakage. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` gained the invariant-check and observable-result-evidence sections.
- **Asolaria narrative package** (issue #78, repo-local scope only): canonical [SIMPLICIO-MAP-OF-MAPS.md](./SIMPLICIO-MAP-OF-MAPS.md), [REDUCTIONS.md](./REDUCTIONS.md), and the bounded campaign artifact set under `.specs/strategy/campaigns/2026-Q3-asolaria-on-metal/` (`CAMPAIGN.md`, `HYPOTHESIS.md`, `ROUTING.md`, `LANDING.md`, `DEMO.md`, `CASE-STUDY.md`) plus a fixture-backed unit test verifying required docs, links, and explicit external dependencies.
- **Asolaria package, deploy-ready follow-up** (issue #78 closeout): two self-contained static pages (`site/simplicio-on-metal/index.html`, `site/asolaria-integration/index.html`); a reproducible 5-iteration orientation-cost demo (`scripts/demo-asolaria-loop.mjs`, `npm run demo:asolaria`) writing `.specs/strategy/campaigns/2026-Q3-asolaria-on-metal/DEMO-RUN.md`; and a fail-closed reduction proof-trail benchmark (`scripts/reductions-benchmark.mjs`, `npm run benchmark:reductions`) writing `docs/evidence/reductions-benchmark.json`. All narrative docs cross-linked to the new artifacts; new unit tests spawn both scripts in `--check` mode.

Autonomous-loop evolution — the best patterns of the sibling repos (simplicio-loop, simplicio-dev-cli, simplicio-mapper) ported into the engine (see PRD.md):

- **`marketing-engine loop`** (`lib/cli/loop.ts`, `lib/loop/journal.ts`): one command drains the draft-piece backlog through generate's real gates with durable attempt memory — stable failure fingerprints in `.simplicio/loop/journal.jsonl` (`marketing-loop-state/v1`), `PROGRESS|STALLED` verdicts, and skip-after-3-identical-failures instead of retrying forever; `--mode drain|converge`, `--max-iter`, `--client`; yool-board tuple per piece; optional fail-open bridge to the simplicio-loop Python journal (`MARKETING_LOOP_PY_WORKERS=1`).
- **Verified publication** (`lib/publish/verify-pipeline.ts`): manifest contract → claims gate → compliance recheck → publish with classified retry (transient provider errors only, MAX 5; deterministic gate failures fail closed with zero provider calls); mechanical `marketing-publish-receipt/v1` next to each manifest; DRY_RUN never fakes a `published` transition.
- **Two-track observability** (`lib/observability/events.ts`): `marketing-event/v1` stream — human line on stderr + JSONL under `.simplicio/events.jsonl` with rotation, `SIMPLICIO_DISABLE_RUN_LOG` kill-switch and fail-open semantics; generate/promote/campaign/loop/publish instrumented.
- **Savings ledger** (`lib/observability/savings.ts`): hash-chained `simplicio.savings-event/v1` receipts with `proof.kind` always `"estimated"` and a labeled estimator (`heuristic:chars-div-4`) — estimates are never presented as measurements; `verifyChain()` detects tampering.
- **Versioned artifact contracts** (`lib/contracts/validate.ts`, `contracts/marketing-artifacts/v1/`): every persisted JSON carries a self-describing `schema` field validated by a dependency-free subset JSON Schema validator; fixtures generated by running the real producers (`scripts/gen-fixtures.mjs`) with a two-sided drift gate (`e2e/contracts.spec.ts`).
- **`marketing-engine doctor`** (`lib/cli/doctor.ts`): read-only self-diagnostic — provider keys, piece counts, event-stream health (gate fail rate, stalls), savings-chain integrity, loop journal, operator hooks; human on stderr, `marketing-doctor-report/v1` JSON on stdout.
- **Operator layer** (`.claude/skills/`, `hooks/`, `docs/OPERATOR.md`): simplicio-loop plugin installed (loop_stop re-feed hook, fail-closed `action_gate.py`, orient clamp); the super-skill now carries the executable loop protocol (exact `<promise>` sentinel, evidence-gated exit, converge/drain, iteration cap); state split documented (`.simplicio/` = product, `.orchestrator/` = agent session).
- **Guards**: convention lint (`scripts/lint-conventions.mjs`, `npm run lint`) and token/context budget guard with negative self-test (`scripts/token-budget.mjs`, `npm run budget`).
- **MCP transport contract** (`docs/MCP-TRANSPORT.md`): the documented, credential-gated path to wire real creative/publish/ads providers later.

Autonomous SaaS marketing loop across social networks and dev communities (epic #46, issues #47-#60):

- **Channel registry** (`lib/channels/registry.ts`, issue #49): typed registry of 8 social platforms and 41 developer/community portals across 10 languages (id, audience, link policy, tone, publish method, compliance notes, frequency limits).
- **Integration broker** (`lib/integrations/broker.ts`, issue #52): resolves publish/schedule/fetch_metrics/draft_ad/comment_monitor/evidence_capture to the safest adapter (api/mcp/browser/computer-use/manual) per channel, with dry-run simulation and structured failure logging.
- **Community compliance gate** (`lib/compliance/community.ts`, issue #56): anti-spam/etiquette audit with a `pass | fail | needs_review` three-state result — checks that cannot be evaluated (unreadable channel rules, corrupted post history) hold for human review instead of silently passing.
- **Accrual-based analytics scoring** (`lib/analytics/score.ts`, issue #54): ranks amplification candidates by the delta between successive polls (normalized per day), not a single cached snapshot, so slow-compounding threads aren't starved by yesterday's spike; flags implausible vanity-metric spikes as spam risk.
- **Strategy playbooks** (`.specs/strategy/PLAYBOOKS.md`, issue #50): per-channel launch playbook for the 10 priority international dev/community channels.
- **Content templates** (`.specs/pieces/templates/*.md`, `lib/content/templates.ts`, issue #57): five evidence-aware templates (dev article, social derivative, video script, Reddit/forum answer, launch thread) that mark missing evidence explicitly and render English-first before any localized adaptation.
- **Browser/computer-use lane** (`lib/automation/browser-lane.ts`, issue #51): governed evidence capture with redaction and failure-mode classification (login_required, captcha, two_factor, platform_rejection, policy_block); DRY_RUN-gated, live actions require explicit human approval.
- **Paid-growth budget guardrails** (`lib/promotion/budget-guardrail.ts`, issue #55): max daily spend, max CPA/CPL, max experiment duration, and stop-loss enforcement wired into the existing ads-draft flow, plus an append-only promotion-attempt audit log with hypothesis.
- **Campaign CLI** (`lib/cli/campaign.ts`, `lib/campaigns/campaign.ts`, issue #53): `marketing-engine campaign --brief <CAMPAIGN.md>` plans a channel/language/format-tagged piece queue and enforces organic-before-paid by default; `campaign review <id>` summarizes winners/losers/spend.
- **Yool tuple-space board** (`lib/yool/board.ts`, `.specs/architecture/YOOL-BOARD.md`, issue #59): event-sourced tuple board across 13 tuple classes and 11 worker lanes; mandatory agent-manifest guardrails (cpu/disk/timeout quotas); `WorkerGovernor` bounds concurrency per lane.
- **Community reply loop** (`lib/community/reply-loop.ts`, issue #60): classifies incoming comments, assigns risk level, drafts evidence-honest replies for human review; never posts autonomously.
- **Root super-skill** (`.skills/simplicio-loop-marketing/SKILL.md`, issue #48): orchestrates the full discover→...→learn loop by capability.
- **Runtime-first ADR** (`.specs/architecture/ADR-002-runtime-first.md`, issue #47): confirms zero required dependency on `simplicio-sprint`/`simplicio-prompt`.
- **E2E mock launch loop** (`e2e/saas-launch-loop.spec.ts`, issue #58): proves the full loop end-to-end against mocks, DRY_RUN throughout, never a live provider/platform call.

### Fixed

- The watcher gate blocked every DRY_RUN run since its introduction: the `[mock-<name>]` attestation tripped the placeholder check (now expected under DRY_RUN only — outside DRY_RUN it still blocks as a mock-leak detector), the gate verified the raw LLM caption instead of the shipping per-platform caption (which carries the pillar hashtag), pure-numeric brackets (`[2]` TOON list markers) are no longer flagged as placeholders, and mocks echo enough prompt for brief terms to survive into topic-coverage. Fixes the 4 long-red e2e specs (`generate-loop`, `notion-sync`, `promote-loop`).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- Hardened release-readiness and handoff guidance: added `docs/release-readiness.md` with a minimum readiness checklist, claims/evidence rules, and a handoff template; expanded `docs/architecture-map.md`, `docs/domain-map.md`, `docs/local-setup.md`, and `docs/troubleshooting.md` with clearer setup and troubleshooting detail; minor `README.md` update.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- **watcher-gate (N-Nest style)**: independent verification layer in the generate loop that re-checks caption pillar hashtags, script topic coverage, caption length constraints, placeholder leakage, and overpromise language before allowing draft→scheduled transition. Every output receives a `claims_tag`: `MEASURED`, `CANON`, or `UNVERIFIED`.
- **claims-gate**: enforce claims discipline at promote time — UNVERIFIED pieces blocked from ad creation. Watcher reports persisted under `data/gate/<piece-id>.json`.
- `.skills/watcher-gate/SKILL.md`: skill manifest documenting gate rules, integration points, and DoD.
- Piece frontmatter: `claims_tag` and `watcher_report_path` optional fields. Template defaults to `claims_tag: UNVERIFIED`.
- Manifest payload now includes `watcher_report_path`.
- `maybeMarkMeasured` sets `claims_tag: MEASURED` when performance data confirms value.
- Promote loop checks claims gate before creating ad drafts; blocked pieces logged to `data/learnings.md`.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- `<!-- rtk-cli:start -->` block in `AGENTS.md` and
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (CLAUDE.md is a symlink to AGENTS.md)
  documenting optional RTK CLI usage for token-smart shell exploration
  (https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk).
- `.skills/rtk-cli/SKILL.md` skill manifest with plain→rtk mapping,
  trigger examples, and DoD.
- `<!-- yool-tuple-hamt:start -->` capability-addressing block citing
  yool/tuple/HAMT spec v0.2 with mandatory guardrails
  (`cpu_quota_pct=60`, `disk_quota_mb=100`, `timeout_s=300`) per Victor
  Genaro's review.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `qa-tech-specs` now reads channel constraints from `.specs/product/CHANNELS.md`,
  probes assets with `ffprobe` / `identify`, falls back to filename metadata
  when possible, and skips safely with install guidance when local probe tools
  are unavailable.
- The generate loop now writes `qa-tech-specs.json` per piece, blocks pieces
  that fail hard platform-spec checks before scheduling, and records the QA
  report path in the manifest for successful runs.
- Wavespeed image and video providers now support real model selection,
  batch-oriented variant expansion with concurrency capped at 5, and mocked
  local coverage for image downloads plus WAN video polling.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Compliance loading now honors `ACTIVE_CLIENT`, reads additive client override
  rules from `.specs/clients/<client>/COMPLIANCE.override.md`, and writes warn
  lines to a weekly digest plus repeat-block alerts to `data/learnings.md`.
- Blocking compliance reports now move local pieces to `review`, persist the
  report in `data/compliance-blocked/`, and keep the pipeline metadata pointed
  at the canonical `data/compliance/<piece>.json` audit trail.
- `generate` now routes compliance through the shared loader instead of the old
  inline regex helper, and the repo ships a template
  `.specs/clients/_template/COMPLIANCE.override.md` plus focused coverage for
  override loading, escalation, and review transitions.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `marketing-engine sync` now pulls Notion calendar rows into the host
  workspace `.marketing-engine/pieces/`, rendering new piece files from
  `.specs/pieces/piece-template.md` and recording the linked `notion_page_id`
  plus the last synced remote fingerprint.
- Notion sync conflicts now preserve the local piece file and append the remote
  snapshot as a comment block instead of overwriting the frontmatter or losing
  local edits.
- `generate` now back-syncs linked pieces to Notion when they advance to
  `scheduled`, and `promote` marks linked published pieces as `measured` in
  both the local piece file and the Notion calendar.
- `.ralph/sync-calendar.sh` now calls the real `marketing-engine sync`
  command, and the repo adds focused Notion sync coverage for creation,
  conflict handling, and status back-sync paths.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `DeepSeekProvider` now picks `deepseek-chat` for `caption` and
  `translation`, while reasoning-heavy tasks route through
  `deepseek-reasoner`.
- DeepSeek pricing now resolves the correct model family in
  `lib/providers/cost.ts`, with optional per-1k token env overrides for chat
  and reasoner tiers.
- Added provider coverage that asserts the DeepSeek request shape, retry
  behavior, usage accounting, and model-specific cost calculation.
- Synchronized the package version metadata across `package.json` and
  `package-lock.json`.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `OllamaProvider` now normalizes `OLLAMA_HOST`, preserves the configured
  `OLLAMA_MODEL`, and throws a descriptive unreachable-host error that points
  operators to start Ollama or change the host before the fallback chain moves
  on.
- Added local adapter coverage that asserts the Ollama `/api/chat` request
  payload and retry behavior when the local server is offline.
- Synchronized the published package metadata version between `package.json`
  and `package-lock.json`.
- Added the missing scheduler helper parameter annotations in
  `lib/schedule/{linux,mac}.ts` so the repo-wide typecheck can complete again.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `marketing-engine schedule` now routes install, status, and uninstall through
  platform-aware launchd and cron backends, including macOS uninstall/status
  support and a Windows manual Task Scheduler warning instead of silent writes.
- Scheduler preview mode now prints the exact launchd plist bodies or cron
  lines that would be installed, and the Linux cadence now correctly renders
  `22:00` and `09:00` as `0 22 * * *` / `0 9 * * *`.
- Added scheduler round-trip E2E coverage against temporary cron and launchd
  directories, plus updated setup guidance for the new CLI commands.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Provider pricing and usage estimation now live in
  `lib/providers/cost.ts`, keeping the editable pricing table and
  `char/4` fallback heuristic in one shared module.
- Real LLM adapters now emit a concrete retry attempt count, and
  `data/llm-usage.jsonl` persists `tokens`, `cost_usd`, and the final
  `attempt` number from the provider call instead of logging only a
  router-level success marker.
- Missing SDK usage payloads now warn once per provider/model pair while
  still producing cost estimates from the shared fallback token
  heuristic.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `lib/pieces/frontmatter.ts` now enforces `locale` as a required frontmatter
  field, matching the documented piece template contract.
- `lib/pieces/id.ts` now computes ISO weeks from UTC date parts, preventing
  timezone-dependent week rollover bugs in `PIECE-YYYYWww-NNN` ids.
- `lib/pieces/store.ts` now exports `list`, `read`, and `write` aliases in
  addition to the existing `*Piece*` helpers so the public API matches the issue
  contract more directly.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `marketing-engine new-piece`, `status`, and `logs` now operate against the
  host project's `.marketing-engine/` workspace instead of assuming runtime
  files live at the host root.
- `new-piece` now renders from `.specs/pieces/piece-template.md`, prints the
  created file path directly, and scans existing weekly piece files so repeated
  CLI invocations do not reuse the same `PIECE-YYYYWww-NNN` id.
- `status` and `logs` now return infra exit code `2` when the workspace has not
  been initialized yet, while still succeeding cleanly when the data directory
  exists but the usage log file is empty.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `marketing-engine promote` now reads and writes its runtime artefacts from the
  host project's `.marketing-engine/{data,pieces,outputs}` workspace by
  default, matching the scaffolded project layout.
- Winner drafts now honor `provider_override.ads` from the source piece
  frontmatter, and the CLI summary output matches the documented
  `promoted: N | losers: M | skipped: K` format.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- `marketing-engine generate` now resolves the host project's
  `.marketing-engine/{pieces,outputs,data}` workspace by default instead of
  assuming runtime files live at the host root.
- `lib/cli/generate.ts` now honors the `MAX_ITER` environment variable in
  addition to the existing `--max-iter` flag, and the E2E coverage exercises
  both the host-workspace defaults and the capped iteration flow.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- `e2e/provider-factories.spec.ts` exercises the non-`DRY_RUN` factory path so
  the suite proves the repo returns real provider adapters instead of production
  mocks.

### Changed

- E2E coverage now mirrors the Sprint 0 acceptance language more closely:
  `e2e/cli-init.spec.ts` and `e2e/cli-scan.spec.ts` split the host-project
  scaffold and scan coverage, `e2e/generate-loop.spec.ts` asserts structured
  usage-log tasks, and `e2e/matrix.spec.ts` proves that editing
  `.specs/architecture/PROVIDERS.md` changes routing without code edits.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` now documents how to update `CHANGELOG.md`, and the PR
  template links directly to the changelog checklist target.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- `lib/providers/matrix.ts` parses `.specs/architecture/PROVIDERS.md` as the single
  source of routing truth (ADR-001). Embedded defaults are used when the file is
  missing or malformed, with a stderr warning.
- `lib/providers/policy.ts` — shared retry/backoff/timeout helper (`withRetry`),
  per-provider pricing table and `estimateCost`/`estimateTokens` helpers.
- `lib/router.ts` exposes `runWithFallback` — wraps any provider call with the
  primary/fallback chain documented in `PROVIDERS.md` and writes one structured
  line per attempt to `data/llm-usage.jsonl` (`ok`, `fallback_used`, `attempt`,
  `latency_ms`).
- `lib/data/runs.ts` and `lib/data/manifest.ts` write the artefacts the AGENTS
  Definition of Done requires: `data/runs.jsonl` per piece run and
  `outputs/<client>/<date>/<piece-id>/manifest.json` per piece.
- `lib/pieces/{id,frontmatter,store}.ts` — piece engine. ISO-8601 week-numbered
  IDs (`PIECE-YYYYWww-NNN`), zero-dependency YAML frontmatter parser, state
  machine (`draft → scheduled → published → measured`, side state `review`).
- `lib/cli/generate.ts` — real generation loop that reads `pieces/`, routes
  every task through the matrix + fallback chain, runs inline compliance,
  writes outputs/script/captions/compliance.json/manifest.json, transitions
  status, and appends to `data/runs.jsonl`.
- `lib/cli/promote.ts` — real promotion loop that classifies `data/analytics.jsonl`
  (top/bottom 20% by save rate, ≥100 impressions), writes `ads-draft.json`
  for winners, appends `data/learnings.md` for losers.
- `lib/calendar/notion.ts` — Notion calendar reader (`pullCalendar`, `syncToLocal`,
  `pushStatus`). DRY_RUN-safe.
- `lib/publish/adaptlypost.ts` — real AdaptlyPost wiring with retry/backoff;
  DRY_RUN still writes `adaptlypost-draft.json` locally.
- `lib/publish/meta-ads.ts` — Meta Ads draft builder + `data/promotions.jsonl`
  writer. Real Meta API call is a stub (calls into the meta-ads MCP layer when
  available).
- `lib/analytics/{meta,tiktok,youtube}.ts` — DRY_RUN keeps deterministic synthetic
  data; non-DRY paths call Graph / TikTok Business / YouTube Data APIs.
- `lib/compliance/{generic,loader}.ts` — executable cross-vertical audit, writes
  `data/compliance/<piece>.json`, escalates blocks to `data/compliance-blocked/`,
  exposes `detectStreaks` for the alerts module.
- `lib/skills/{humanizer,brand-voice}.ts` — executable critic skills (regex pass
  + LLM secondary stub, voice-axis distance scoring).
- `lib/qa/tech-specs.ts` — ffprobe/identify wrapper with filename fallback;
  per-platform validation against `CHANNELS.md` specs.
- `lib/observability/{cost,ab-report,failures}.ts` — cost summary + HTML report,
  A/B per (task, provider) ROI table, failure-rate detector + webhook poster.
- `lib/schedule/cron.ts` — cron / launchd install / uninstall / status helpers
  with marker block isolation.
- CLI gains: `new-piece`, `status`, `logs`, `cost`, `ab-report`, `alerts`,
  `sync`, `schedule`. Each delegates to a TypeScript module via the bundled
  `tsx` runtime.
- E2E coverage (Playwright) across all of the above: matrix parsing,
  fallback chain, policy retry/timeout/cost, pieces engine, init/scan/generate
  loop, promote loop, compliance, qa-tech-specs, observability, CLI surface.

### Changed

- `lib/router.ts` no longer hardcodes routing tables; everything resolves via
  `lib/providers/matrix.ts`.
- `lib/providers/{llm,image,video}.ts` now contain real adapter classes that
  call concrete APIs. Mock variants live under `lib/providers/__mocks__/` and
  the factory switches based on `DRY_RUN`.
- `bin/marketing-engine.mjs` `generate` / `promote` are no longer placeholders.

### Notes

- All new external behavior is gated by `DRY_RUN=true` (the default) — CI never
  reaches real API endpoints.
- The mock providers preserve the original deterministic output, so previously
  authored e2e specs continue to pass.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- CLI scaffold (`bin/marketing-engine.mjs`): `init`, `scan`, `check` commands.
- Provider type interfaces (`lib/providers/{types,llm,image,video}.ts`) and
  mock implementations.
- Publish + analytics scaffolds (`lib/publish/adaptlypost.ts`,
  `lib/analytics/{meta,tiktok,youtube}.ts`).
- Specs tree under `.specs/`: architecture (DESIGN, PROVIDERS, ROUTING-MATRIX,
  ADR-001), product (BRAND, CHANNELS, COMPLIANCE, PERSONAS, PILLARS), piece +
  campaign templates, client `_template/` overrides.
- 11 SKILL.md documents under `.skills/` (provider-neutral skills).
- E2E suite (Playwright): CLI, compliance, caption-format, tech-specs,
  provider-router, AdaptlyPost-publish.
- CI workflow + DoD workflow.
- Remotion video explainer (PT-BR + EN) under `video/`.
- Bilingual README + SETUP + CONTRIBUTING + AGENTS.md (charter) + Apache-2.0
  LICENSE.
