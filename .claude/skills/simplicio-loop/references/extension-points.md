# Extension points — the 48 named binding points

These are the named points where work happens. For each, if the host runtime exposes a native
capability, BIND it (deterministic, local-first, near-zero token). If not, the LLM performs the
fallback with standard tools. The skill depends on the ABSTRACTION, never on a specific runtime.

| Extension point | What it does | LLM fallback (always available) |
|---|---|---|
| `orient` | Compressed repo/work map | `rg` / `git grep` / `git log --oneline -10`, read few files. Also: `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json` (Understand Anything) for rich structural graph + semantic search + guided tours |
| `pattern_match` | Match a bug's root-cause fingerprint against a structured store of past patterns (`.orchestrator/patterns.jsonl`). Each pattern has: `fingerprint` (sha256 of root_cause+file), `root_cause`, `symptom_pattern`, `fix_summary`, `sibling_files`, `hit_count`, `last_seen`. When hit_count > 1, flag the module for structural attention. | LLM searches past PRs/closed-issues for similar error patterns by keyword, extracts root cause and fix from git history, writes a structured entry to `.orchestrator/patterns.jsonl`. |
| `recall` | Prior decisions / precedents | read ADRs / git history / past PRs |
| `normalize` | Work-item → canonical schema | LLM maps fields by hand |
| `deterministic_edit` | Mechanical file writer (zero-token apply of a decided change) | LLM applies edit with file tool |
| `autoscale` | Safe fleet size from machine profile | formula in orchestration.md |
| `plan` / `decide` | Plan / decision support. Runnable freeze: a vague goal's LLM decomposition (subtasks, per-item ACs, `depends_on`) is frozen, ordered and gated by `scripts/task_backlog.py init` — genesis-aware (an empty repo demands `--genesis` and a leading `scaffold` item) | LLM reasons it out |
| `execute` | Local agent fan-out for mass/mechanical work | LLM does it or spawns host sub-agents |
| `issue_factory` | Full orchestrator loop: discover→claim→implement→PR | manual pipeline (Steps 2–6) |
| `claim` | Atomic claim on a work-item (cross-session safe) | `gh label "in-progress"` + lockfile |
| `worktree` | Per-item isolated checkout — the DEFAULT isolation mode (one worktree per item → zero cross-item conflict); opt out to a shared checkout only for big compiled projects where a fresh build/target dir per item is too costly | `git worktree add` per item; prune on teardown. Fallback: conflict-aware sharing of one checkout (disjoint files parallel, overlapping serialized) |
| `diagnostics` | Parse build/test output → structured errors → iterate-until-green | run the test, read the log, fix |
| `validate` / `smoke` | Run-verification ("works, not just compiles") | invoke binary directly, run affected tests |
| `pr` / `evidence` | PR open/update + verifiable evidence ledger | `gh pr` + receipt file |
| `watcher` | Durable scheduler / poller (survives reboot) | OS cron / scheduled task / session loop |
| `savings_ledger` | REAL token spend tracking per session | estimate `ceil(chars/4)` |
| `capability_rank` | Rank which skill/tool fits a sub-task | LLM picks |
| `compress` | Context compression / output clamping | summarize to bullets, head+tail clamp |
| `trajectory` | Record run outcome for self-improvement | manual log |
| `learn` | Learn from run — update precedents / memory | manual ADR |
| `human_gate` | Async human approval channel | ask user inline |
| `shell_exec` | Clamped shell execution (structured output, bounded size) | Bash with `\| head -N` |
| `retry` | Classified retry+backoff by failure class | manual retry loop |
| `status` | Live observability dashboard | `gh` queries |
| `security` | Supply-chain / secret scan | `rg` for secrets |
| `intake` | Ingest work from sprint/board link — or, with no board, the local backlog (`task_backlog.py next`) | `gh issue list` |
| `dependency_graph` | Inter-item ordering as a resumable DAG (B after A; independents fan out); re-run skips done nodes (at item level, the frozen backlog's `depends_on` — `scripts/task_backlog.py` — IS this DAG for Phase 0 decompositions). At code level, it also means "what else breaks if I touch this?" — runnable form: `scripts/impact_audit.py audit <root> --file <seed> --cover <planned-file> --json > .orchestrator/impact-audit.json` maps local dependencies, reverse dependents, and related tests for the planned task surface. `high` gaps block missing callers/dependents; `--fail-on medium` blocks uncovered local deps/tests for shared contracts. | LLM topo-sorts by depends-on/blocked-by, runs ready first, journals done node-ids to resume; for code impact, it uses `rg`/imports/git grep to enumerate local dependencies, reverse callers, and related tests, then widens the plan before editing |
| `durable_workflow` | Per-item pipeline (intake→plan→edit→validate→deliver) as a resumable phase state-machine; retry skips done phases | LLM drives phases, journals which phase each item reached, resumes from last completed |
| `work_queue` | Durable priority queue that runs+auto-retries+requeues-stuck, with a write-serialization lock for shared checkouts. Local binding: `scripts/task_backlog.py` — `next` honors `depends_on` and re-prints the one claimed item; `done` is exit-12-gated on the verified task anchor; `skip` quarantines with a reason; an exact `empty` print is the drain dry signal | LLM keeps queue in JSONL/SQLite, pops by priority, re-enqueues on fail, lockfile+TTL guards shared-tree writes |
| `resource_governor` | Dynamic mid-loop throttle: decide when to back off + machine-tier ceilings before scaling a wave | LLM re-probes CPU/RAM/load each tick, reduces fleet / sleeps longer under load, degrades tiers |
| `delivery_gate` | One DoD gate: AC check + run-verification + regression guard + diff self-review + delivery certificate. Runnable form: the **task anchor** (`scripts/task_anchor.py`) freezes the ACs at intake, `check` flags goal-drift each turn (anti-deviation), `mark` records a per-AC receipt, and `gate` (exit 12) BLOCKS "done"/PR-open while any AC is unverified. | LLM walks the AC checklist, runs affected tests, reviews own diff, writes a certificate into the receipt |
| `action_gate` | Risk-classify every mutation (safe/auto/ask) vs allow/deny + hardline blocklist before it runs | LLM pattern-matches action vs irreversible-op list, secret-scans, proceeds/auto-runs/escalates to `human_gate` |
| `repo_conventions` | LEARN the repo's own playbook, not just what's documented. Worker `scripts/repo_conventions.py learn` mines the git history (branch-name scheme, commit convention + REAL scope list, ticket pattern — by frequency) + merged PRs via `gh` (title pattern, label vocab, PR-body sections) + static config (CONTRIBUTING.md/AGENTS.md/pyproject.toml for a Conventional-Commits/commitizen hint, and the PR template for body-section structure) + `discover_architecture()` (the repo's OWN architecture/design docs — ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN.md, `.specs/architecture/*.md` + `ADR-*.md`, `docs/adr/*.md` — plus its OWN test-runner and lint command from Makefile/package.json/`scripts/check.py`/lint-config files) → one hash-pinned `.orchestrator/conventions.json` (`source=history\|config\|default`, confidence-gated: sparse history degrades to an honest default, never an over-fit guess; `architecture` degrades to an honest empty `{docs: [], test_runner: null, lint_cmd: null}`, never a fabricated doc/command). Steps 4–6 apply it deterministically via `repo_conventions.py branch`/`commit`, and Step 4 reads `architecture.docs` before any edit + runs `architecture.test_runner`/`lint_cmd` instead of a generic guess. PR bodies are untrusted data; a learned convention never overrides a safety gate. | LLM reads CONTRIBUTING.md + AGENTS.md + .github/ + pyproject.toml + any ARCHITECTURE.md/DESIGN.md/ADRs it can find AND skims `git log`/`gh pr list` for the dominant branch/commit/PR pattern, emits the same structured conventions summary that shapes Step 4–6 (branch naming, commit scopes, PR checklist, CI/lint/test gates, architecture docs to honor). |
| `pr_template` | Discover .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, parse structured sections (what/why, how to test, checklist), map completed ACs to checklist items, and auto-fill the PR body before creation. Ensures every PR matches the maintainer's expected format on first submission. Runnable form: `scripts/pr_evidence.py build --require-evidence` assembles the body with the **item-by-item AC checklist** (from the task anchor) + the **prints/recordings** captured under `.orchestrator/tee/web`, honoring the discovered template; it FAILS CLOSED (exit 3) rather than open an evidence-less PR. | LLM reads .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md, maps completed acceptance criteria to each checklist item, fills in what/why from the item description and the implementation summary, lists changed files with rationale. |
| `reuse_precedent` | Match item by fingerprint to a prior SOLVED run → reuse not regenerate → ingest the new solution back | LLM greps past PRs/closed issues/solved-patterns journal for the fingerprint, applies it, appends new solution |
| `sibling_search` | Given a changed file/function/pattern, find all other call sites or implementations with the same pattern across the repo. Enumerate sibling paths so the fix covers the entire bug class, not just one reported instance. Critical for projects where maintainers reject single-site fixes. | LLM uses `grep -rn` / `rg` for the symbol/pattern, traces each candidate with `git log -p -S`, reads each sibling to confirm the same bug class, then includes all confirmed siblings in the fix scope. |
| `source_adapter` | Uniform source connector contract (list_ready/get_details/claim/update/attach/close) bound per source | LLM calls the source CLI/REST per verb; lockfile/label claim with TTL for cross-session safety |
| `prompt_budget` | Token-budgeted prompt envelope + prompt-fragment cache: assemble only what fits the per-task ceiling | LLM caps per-subtask context to a fixed budget (chars/4), trims to the few files that matter, small on-disk cache |
| `model_route` | Pick cheapest viable substrate per sub-task (L0 deterministic→local→mid→reasoning→paid), escalate only on need. LMCache KV cache (`pip install lmcache`) — speeds up local inference by reducing TTFT via a KV cache reused across loop turns | LLM applies the tier table: mechanical→L0, mass→local, normal→mid, LARGE/CRITICAL/security→reasoning |
| `model_preflight` | Probe a usable model substrate is present+healthy before routing generation; else fail-fast or next tier | LLM pings endpoint / confirms local model+runner with a trivial call; on fail picks next tier or stops |
| `toolchain_detect` | Detect which build/lint/typecheck/test toolchains the repo actually has so validate/diagnostics route right | LLM inspects manifests/lockfiles/config + probes PATH to pick the correct toolchain per stack |
| `checkpoint_restore` | Snapshot run/repo state before a risky batch; restore to known-good if validation/delivery fails | LLM tags a commit / stashes / copies the journal before destructive ops, restores on failure |
| `notify` | Push progress/blocker/digest to a human channel + receive inbound approvals (async approval I/O) | LLM writes digest/approval-request to a file or session; no-reply = block the destructive op (headless rule) |
| `endpoint_compare` | Compare web/API/service surfaces to detect drift; gaps become follow-up items or blockers. Runnable form: `scripts/flow_audit.py audit <root> --fail-on high --json > .orchestrator/flow-audit.json` maps UI actions, frontend HTTP calls, backend endpoints, backend service calls, AND the persistence link (endpoint → repository/ORM/SQL, covering raw SQL + Prisma/Sequelize/TypeORM/Eloquent/SQLAlchemy/Django ORM/Mongoose-shaped calls). It blocks on frontend calls without backend endpoints and stubbed backend endpoints; `--fail-on medium` also blocks unclassified UI/API/service loose ends AND a non-GET endpoint with no observed persistence call, for flows whose AC promises integration. | LLM lists UI actions, frontend calls, backend routes/controllers, OpenAPI entries, service calls, and DB/ORM calls with `rg`, then diffs by hand to flag missing endpoints, stub handlers, dead writes, orphan callers, and unclassified loose ends |
| `web_verify` | Drive a real browser (navigate/click/console) to prove a UI/web change works end-to-end; capture screenshot+trace as evidence | Playwright via `playwright-mcp` or headless `npx playwright` / `pytest-playwright`; evidence = artifact path, not pixels (see web-evidence.md) |
| `video_evidence` | Produce a demo video of a screen/feature as evidence — two engines | **DEFAULT = Playwright** native session recording (`video_evidence verify --url …` records the real browser drive to `.webm`→`.mp4`) for the normal moving-proof flow; **hyperframes** (`npx hyperframes render` — heygen-com/hyperframes) only for an EXPLICIT custom explainer request ("make a video of screen X"), assembling the `web_verify` screenshots into a deterministic captioned MP4. Evidence = video path, not bytes (see video-evidence.md); BLOCK if the toolchain is absent |
| `web_research` | Fetch current external knowledge (docs/CVE/version/SDK error), gated behind local-memory-miss, with provenance | LLM uses built-in web search/fetch only after local miss; records source URL as provenance |
| `transform_guard` | Verify a compaction preserved every code/URL/path/version token (fail-closed to original) | LLM extracts both token sets and compares by hand |

Rule: any change already DECIDED goes through `deterministic_edit` — never hand-write a file body
or regenerate it with a model when a mechanical apply exists. Reach for a paid model only for
genuine reasoning the deterministic layer cannot do (model routing in orchestration.md).

## simplicio-loop's bound operators (REQUIRED for the loop drive)

The `simplicio-loop` companion skill is NOT runtime-optional about two of these points — it binds
them to two installed CLIs (hard deps of `pip install simplicio-loop`) and BLOCKS if absent:

| Point(s) | Bound CLI | What replaces the LLM fallback |
|---|---|---|
| `orient` / `recall` | `simplicio-mapper` (`simplicio-mapper scan . --json`; `macro` for an instant skeleton, `status` for the deep-pass phase, `index . --json` for a forced synchronous build; v0.13+: `inspect . --json` as the artifact evidence gate, `handoff . --for-llm toon` for the compact context-pack that feeds the goal (TOON-rendered per-turn, #92; `--json` fallback + logged reason when the installed mapper predates `--for-llm`); v0.14+: `ask . <verb> <arg> --json` for low-token structured queries — `impact` feeds `dependency_graph`, `tests-for` feeds `validate` — and `sync --check`/`drift --check` as docs-staleness/spec-drift gates in the DoD pass) | the repo SURVEY — `.simplicio/*.json` (project-map, precedent-index, symbol-index, call-graph) instead of ad-hoc LLM reads |
| `execute` / `deterministic_edit` / `validate` / `diagnostics` | `simplicio-dev-cli task` (binary `simplicio-dev-cli`, pkg `simplicio-cli`) | the OPERATOR — applies a decided change via its 6-layer contract (mapper→precedent→prompt→diff→test→verify, ≤3 retries); the AI never hand-writes the diff inside the loop |

This is the one place the abstraction is realized by a REQUIRED binding rather than an optional
one. Everywhere else the inverted-dependency rule below still holds. See
`.claude/skills/simplicio-loop/SKILL.md` (§ Bound operators).

A host runtime MAY detect that this skill is running (by name) and auto-bind its native commands
to these points — transparently, at near-zero token cost — without the skill ever naming that
runtime. The binding lives in the host runtime, not here. This is the INVERTED DEPENDENCY: the
skill stays universal; the runtime injects the speed.

## State-file owner map (`.orchestrator/loop/*.json`)

Every cross-component state file below has exactly ONE producer and a documented freshness/
lifecycle contract — this is the fix for the "two components silently disagree about a shared
state file" bug class (the 685600b spindle/latch mismatch; the HANDOFF.md three-writer clobber).

| File | Producer | Consumers | Freshness / lifecycle |
|---|---|---|---|
| `watcher_state.json` | `scripts/watcher_verify.py verify` (in-repo, mechanical — never hand-write it) | `hooks/loop_stop.py` (`watcher_verify()`, gates the promise), `scripts/cross_agent_wiki.py` (renders MEASURED/UNVERIFIED into SUMMARY.md) | Must echo the CURRENT `watcher_challenge.json` (`challenge` + `goal_fp` fields) and have `checked_at >= challenge.written_at`; a receipt failing either check is treated as `UNVERIFIED` regardless of `match`. Deleted by `loop_stop.py` on every clean stop. |
| `watcher_challenge.json` | `hooks/loop_stop.py` (`write_watcher_challenge`, at the end of every re-feed turn) | `scripts/watcher_verify.py` (echoes it into the receipt), `hooks/loop_stop.py` (`watcher_verify()`, validates the echo) | One nonce per iteration; overwritten on every re-feed. Deleted by `loop_stop.py` on every clean stop. |
| `HANDOFF.md` | `hooks/loop_stop.py` (`write_handoff`, rich: frozen goal + AC checklist + last attempts) for an INCOMPLETE stop (cap/STOP/spindle/operator-missing); `scripts/handoff.py` (`cmd_handoff`) for an explicit spindle handoff to a named next agent | `scripts/cross_agent_wiki.py` (embeds it into SUMMARY.md), any fresh agent/runtime picking the repo up cold | `write_handoff` does NOT call `cross_agent_wiki.py handoff` afterward (it would immediately overwrite the richer content it just wrote — the fixed three-writer bug); `scripts/handoff.py`'s spindle write is a distinct, deliberate, explicit API call, not a silent background overwrite. |
| `anchor.json` | `scripts/task_anchor.py set`/`mark` (agent-invoked, once per item + per AC) | `hooks/loop_stop.py` (`anchor_pending()`, drift/AC gate), `scripts/watcher_verify.py` (independent recompute) | Frozen at intake; re-`set` with an unchanged goal preserves progress, a changed goal requires `--force`. |
| `journal.jsonl` | `scripts/loop_journal.py record` (agent-invoked); `hooks/loop_stop.py` (`auto_record_journal`, a minimal fallback record only when the agent didn't record one this turn) | `scripts/hierarchical_planner.py` (phase timing/stall), `hooks/loop_stop.py` (journal tail in `write_handoff`) | Append-only. The fallback record uses `gate: blocked` (never `fail`) so it can never itself trigger stall detection — it is a presence signal, not attempt memory. |
| `phase.json` | `scripts/hierarchical_planner.py plan` | `hooks/loop_stop.py` (re-feed header hint) | Re-planned every `DEFAULT_PLAN_INTERVAL` iterations or on stall. |
| `backlog.jsonl` (`.orchestrator/backlog/`) | `scripts/task_backlog.py` (`init` freezes; `next`/`done`/`skip` transition item states — agent-invoked) | the Phase 0 per-item cycle (SKILL.md § Phase 0), drain-mode dry detection (an exact `empty` from `next`) | Frozen at Phase 0 intake; re-`init` with the same master goal preserves per-item progress, a changed goal requires `--force`; `done` only closes an item whose armed anchor gate passed. |

If a machine has no `.claude/skills/simplicio-loop/SKILL.md` (a bare `simplicio-tasks` loop with
no `simplicio-loop` companion), none of the watcher/anchor/journal producers are expected to run —
every reader above is fail-open on a missing file and simply reports `UNVERIFIED`/absent, never a
trap.
